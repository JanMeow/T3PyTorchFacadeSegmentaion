# T3PyTorchFacadeSegmentaion


" One of the major problem in the emerging ciruclar practice in the construction indutry is the lack of useful database and the small time window for the designer to produce a design before the building is demolished"

"Any Subsequent or intermediate storing of materials is in fact not desirable because building componenets are extremely heavy and transporting them to an intermediate location will undermine a lot of the carbon footprint saved from using old materials which contradicts to the initial intention"

"To promote circular construction and make up for the current gap in the practice, an Ai segmentation Model is developed to target different facade components in the list of demolished buildings and turn the 2D data from the web into 3D using also an NLP method to extract the dimensions of the elements in the description, A reinforcement model is also trained to produce facade design using stackable reuse elements."

"All these will be deployed to support the software in partA so as to fasten the entire design process with used materials."
